# Python notes

A collection of Jupyter notebooks for exploring python and its libraries.

These are not organized lecture notes or tutorials, but rather random files
on different topics with varying degree of difficulty.


## Use
The notebooks should run on any recent version of python and imported
libraries. However, no attempt has been made to test correct execution 
with different versions. 

The `*.py` source files are generated with the excellent
[jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) extension.
